# Payments QA & Testing Demo

This repository demonstrates a practical, risk-based approach to quality
engineering for a payments-style system.

The focus is on:
- Testing strategy for money movement
- API testing with failure and edge cases
- CI/CD quality gates
- Infrastructure testing and smoke validation
- Reasoning about real-world incidents and trade-offs

The examples favor clarity, safety, and intent over production-scale complexity.
